In Innovation System (IS) literature, system building has become increasingly central to the understanding of market formation in entrepreneurship and technological innovations, emphasizing strategic interventions and coordinated collective action in dedicated attempts at creating novel markets or systems for innovation (Musiolik et al., 2020; Hellsmark and Jacobsson, 2009; Musiolik and Markard, 2011). The creation of stakeholder networks and the development of favorable sociotechnical conditions (known as “system-level resources”), requires coordinated effects of multiple organizations or actors within the network, and is rarely the result of individual action (Lynn et al., 1996; van Lente et al., 2003; Musiolik et al., 2012; Planko et al., 2017). The development of innovation systems are reliant on more than just supply and demand side, also involving multiple intermediaries who aid market formation and technological transitions. In existing literature, there is broad consensus that intermediaries have a catalyzing effect on the processes within which they intermediate (Klerkx and Leeuwis, 2009; Kanda et al., 2020; Howells, 2006; van Lente et al., 2003). Further, research has indicated that innovation systems often span beyond national or regional borders (Binz and Truffer, 2017; Heiberg and Truffer, 2022; van der Loos et al., 2020; Carlsson, 2006; Gosens et al., 2015). Development of transnational innovation systems are challenged by cultural differences, territorial context, and different actor strategies, but ultimately depends on “how actors combine knowledge, investment, markets, and legitimacy to new configurations that work”, similar to other types of innovation systems (Binz and Truffer, 2017, p. 1287).
The education sector is one area that, like many other societal institutions, are undergoing a significant transition process, and more and more education is enabled by digital technology through online formats, digital solutions, and other software to enhance teaching and learning. EdTech, or educational technology, refers to the use of technology to support, enhance, and optimize teaching and learning in educational settings. This can include a wide range of tools and approaches, such as online learning platforms, educational software and apps, educational games and simulations, and technology-enhanced teaching methods. The goal of EdTech is to improve educational outcomes by leveraging the power of technology to facilitate more engaging, personalized, and effective learning experiences. The development of the EdTech market can be viewed as an innovation system because it is driven by the interaction of various actors, including governments, educational institutions, researchers, and businesses, who all play a role in pushing for the development and adoption of EdTech (Bergek et al., 2008; Binz and Truffer, 2017). These actors work together to create and disseminate new technologies and ideas that can be used to improve teaching and learning. This innovation system is characterized by ongoing experimentation and learning, as actors seek to develop new technologies and refine existing ones to better meet the needs of teachers and learners. By viewing the EdTech market as an innovation system, it is possible to get a better understanding of the factors that drive its development and the challenges and opportunities it presents. At both global, national and institutional level, the increased interest in EdTech is derived from a goal to solve challenges experienced in education, from increased student intake, less resources, and new learning goals, to goals of enhancing teaching and learning capabilities through technology use (Weller, 2018; Williamson, 2021).
In a European context, EdTech market formation is spearheaded by the European EdTech Alliance (EEA), a not-for-profit organization, aimed at the development of EdTech innovation opportunities in the EU. EEA is a consortium spanning various institutions, organizations, and firms, all invested in the formation of a European market for EdTech. To analyze and describe this system building, a functional approach is commonly used to outline two principal components that shape transnational innovation system dynamics: technological innovation and product valuation. Here, seven system functions are used to assess system performance and development, including knowledge production and diffusion, entrepreneurial experimentation, resource mobilization, guidance of the search, market formation, creation of legitimacy, and the creation of positive externalities (Bergek et al., 2008; Binz and Truffer, 2017). While there is an established approach to analyzing this type of system, research as indicated the need for more insights on intermediaries and other system builders involved in transnational innovation processes (Binz and Truffer, 2017; Heiberg and Truffer, 2022; Gosens et al., 2015).
The EEA members form the empirical foundation for this case study. The networks and interactions of the EEA members are used to study the role of intermediaries and system builders in the formation of a transnational innovation system, and how they connect different actors and subsystems to develop system-level resources to better the chances of successful innovation (Binz and Truffer, 2017). to answer this gap, the European EdTech market developments are used as a case, and is explored through the research question:
RQ: What are the characteristics of system building in European EdTech, and what role does intermediaries play in the development of system-level resources?
By examining the characteristics of system building in European EdTech and the role of intermediaries in the development of system-level resources, this research could help to shed light on the factors that drive the development and adoption of EdTech in Europe. It could also provide valuable insights into the role of intermediaries in the innovation process, and how they support the development and adoption of new technologies in a transnational context. The research has the potential to contribute valuable insights to the field of education technology and innovation.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: section 2 provides a conceptual and theoretical background. Section 3 discusses the research setting of EdTech market formation in the EU and introduces the research methods. An analysis of the EU EdTech alliance is performed in section 4, followed by discussion and implications in section 5.
2	Theoretical foundation and analytical framework
2.1	Innovation systems
IS research is based on a central observation that innovation is both an individual and a collective act that involves the interplay of multiple, rationally bounded actors. IS is thus founded on the assumption that determinants of technology diffusion cannot be found solely by investigating individual actors’ strategies, but rather, a thorough examination of an interconnected system of actors and institutions is needed to fully understand the processes of technology diffusion. IS research is usually applied in specific boundaries defining the market of interest for research, for instance, national (NIS)
(Lundvall, 1988, 1992), regional (RIS) (Cooke et al., 1997), sectoral (SIS) (Malerba,
2002; Castellacci, 2008), technological (TIS) (Bergek et al., 2008; Markard and Truffer,
2008), transnational, or even global innovation systems (GIS) (Binz and Truffer, 2017; Heiberg and Truffer, 2022; Gosens et al., 2015). The scope of transnational innovation systems applied in this paper is derived from an understanding of technological innovation systems in an international context. A transnational innovation system is understood as a subsystem of a GIS, with boundaries defined from an empirical perspective (Binz and Truffer, 2017; Gosens et al., 2015). The empirical delineation of boundaries in a transnational context is inspired by the functional analysis approach from TIS research (Bergek et al., 2008, 2015; Binz and Truffer, 2017; Gosens et al., 2015). As such, the IS can be defined as “a dynamic network of agents interacting in a specific economic/industrial area under a particular institutional infrastructure and involved in the generation, diffusion, and utilization of technology” (Carlsson and Stankiewicz, 1991, p. 93). In this conceptualization, an IS is formed by a set of structural elements: actors, networks, and institutions. Actors are firms, knowledge organizations, regulators, investors, and non-governmental organizations (Carlsson and Stankiewicz, 1991; Bergek et al., 2008; Binz and Truffer, 2017; Lundvall, 1992). Networks are shaped by formal groups as industry organizations or certification groups, and informal interactions, for instance, buyer-seller relationships and interorganizational collaborations.
Institutions refer broadly to “the rules of the game”. Concretely, institutions include regulation, laws, standards, but also values and shared expectations. Institutions play a significant role in the legitimization and veracity of emerging technologies by providing resources such as funding and protective spaces for development, but actors and technologies must align their goals to the institutional structures, to succeed and thrive in the system (Decourt, 2019; Musiolik et al., 2012; Bergek et al., 2008; Binz and Truffer, 2017).
2.1.1	Global and transnational innovation systems
A central argument for the development of global and transnational IS research is that innovation is increasingly happening across borders and with collaboration across national and international institutions (Binz and Truffer, 2017; Gosens et al., 2015; van der Loos et al., 2020; Carlsson, 2006; Heiberg and Truffer, 2022). Further, policy is often developed to impact larger geographical areas, for instance the EU set regulations and rules for all member countries, which impact the trajectories and opportunities for innovation. In transnational and global IS’, system demarcation is not based on pre-defined territorial boundaries, but on the networks of actors and institutions involved in creating specific system-level resources (knowledge, market access, financial investment, and technology legitimacy) (Binz and Truffer, 2017). In this context, system building is driven by multi-scalar actor networks and institutions that jointly support or hinder formation and diffusion of an innovation (Binz and Truffer, 2017; Heiberg and Truffer, 2022; Gosens et al., 2015). Depending on how boundaries are defined, such a system can be comprised of a great variation of alternative configurations of subsystems that all have an impact on system formation on a global scale. As such, examining the externalities that support the development of systemlevel resources within an empirically defined subsystem is important to assess “how the combinations of concentrated dispersion with systemic integration determines the emergence of new opportunities for transnational knowledge diffusion and adoption”
(Ernst, 2002, p. 1). Drawing from TIS research, the process of investigation of these structural elements have been defined as a set of system functions that function as
“intermediate variables between structure and system performance” (Jacobsson and Bergek, 2011, p. 46). System functions corresponds with processes that need to take place for an innovation to be diffused, providing an analytical framework that can be applied for an IS across any boundary. While there have been multiple taxonomies developed for a functional analysis of an IS, most rely on the classification articulated by Suurs and Hekkert (2009), visualized in table 1 below (Suurs and Hekkert, 2009; Gosens et al., 2015; Binz and Truffer, 2017).
The framework for a functional IS analysis is a tangible approach to mapping and understanding an emergent field of technological development. Through its seven system functions, visualized in table 1, the central components for the potential success of an emerging IS can be laid out. The functional approach is developed as a methodological tool to aggregate various influences on the dynamics of an IS into a set of key processes, allowing for analysis of how these dynamics influence pushes and pulls for the diffusion of a given technology (Bergek et al., 2015, 2008; Gosens et al., 2015). In functional analysis of an IS, delineation of the field in question is essential to the proper conceptualization of the innovation process investigated. In IS research, innovation is recognized as a complicated process, often highly dependent on the surrounding context structures that provide boundaries, rules, and local expectations to the innovation processes for any given technology. For the validity of IS research, a clear delineation is pivotal to the veracity of the study and the clarity for the reader (Markard et al., 2015; Bergek et al., 2008; Binz and Truffer, 2017).

A central delineating aspect of the case studied in this article, is the focus on intermediaries and their role in system building. In research on transnational IS’, the need for more understanding of the role of intermediaries in system building has been highlighted, but limited research has been done in this area (Binz and Truffer, 2017;

between different actors and countries in the innovation process. This can include research institutions, universities, consultants, venture capitalists, and other organizations that help to connect different actors in the innovation system and provide them with the support and resources they need to develop and commercialize new ideas and technologies.
Intermediaries are essential for innovation systems because they help to bridge gaps between different actors and facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing (Howells, 2006; van Lente et al., 2003; Kivimaa et al., 2019). Intermediaries also play a critical role in the development of technological innovation and product valuation. For example, research institutions may provide access to specialized equipment or expertise that companies or entrepreneurs need to develop their innovations, while venture capitalists may provide funding and support to help entrepreneurs bring their ideas to market. In general, intermediaries provide a range of services that help facilitate the development and adoption of new technologies, such as providing access to research funding, connecting researchers with potential partners, and provide guidance on the economic and financial aspects of technology development and adoption. Intermediaries help to create a more interconnected and dynamic innovation system, which can lead to more rapid development and commercialization of new technologies (Binz and Truffer, 2017; Howells, 2006). Some examples of intermediaries in transnational innovation systems include the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the
European Commission’s Horizon 2020 program, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the United States (WIPO, 2022; European Commission, 2020; NSF, 2022).
Functional IS analysis is a valuable tool for examining the role of intermediaries in facilitating innovation. This method involves identifying the key intermediaries within an innovation system and analyzing how they interact with other actors and institutions within the system. To perform a functional analysis of an innovation system, these steps are typically followed:
1.	Define the boundaries of the innovation system under study, as well as the specific research question or problem that is being addressed.
2.	Identify the key components of the innovation system, such as its actors, institutions, and
technologies.
3.	Analyze how these components interact with each other to support innovation within the global innovation system. This may involve examining the relationships between different actors, institutions, and technologies, as well as the flows of knowledge, resources, and information within the system.
4.	Use a variety of research methods, such as interviews, surveys, and case studies, to gather data about the innovation system and its components.
5.	Use modeling and simulation tools to help visualize and understand the relationships between the various components of the innovation system.
6.	Use the insights and findings from the functional analysis to inform the design and implementation of interventions and policies that are aimed at improving the performance of the innovation system.
Ultimately, the goal of a functional analysis in innovation systems research is to understand how the various components of an IS interact to support innovation, and to identify opportunities for improving the performance of the system (Bergek et al., 2008, 2015; Gosens et al., 2015). By examining the relationships between actors, institutions, and technologies within the IS, it is possible to gain valuable insights that can be used to support development and growth.
In this study, system formation of EdTech in Europe are used as a case to examine the role of intermediaries in system building and in the development of system-level resources in a transnational context. In the following (section 3), The empirical case is introduced to provide boundaries for a functional analysis.


3	Case introduction and methodology
The following will provide an introduction to the case of EdTech market formation by introducing the context for the global interest in EdTech and describe the development of a European market in section 3.1. Section 3.1.1 explain the role of the European EdTech Alliance (EEA) in the formation of a transnational innovation system in Europe. Specifically, the EEA will be defined to establish an empirical foundation for the examination of the role of intermediaries in developing system-level resources towards building a transnational EdTech innovation system. Section 3.1.2 delineates the EEA intermediaries and sets the context for examination. Section 3.2 provides an overview of how data is processed and used for analysis. Section 3.2.1 explains how data is collected, section 3.2.2 explains the process of analyzing public data from web pages and reports, and section 3.2.3 introduces the approach for network analysis utilized.
3.1	EdTech market formation
The global interest in EdTech, or educational technology, has been growing rapidly in recent years. This is due in part to the increasing adoption of technology in education, as well as the growing demand for flexible and personalized learning options. EdTech encompasses a wide range of products and services, including online learning platforms, educational software and apps, virtual and augmented reality technology, and other innovative tools and resources that are used to enhance the learning expe-
rience.
According to a report from Grand View Research, the global EdTech market was valued at approximately $106.46 billion in 2021, and is expected to reach $429.5 billion by 2030 (GVR, 2022). It is currently estimated that only four percent of global education spend is digital – considered to be one of the largest market opportunities yet to be digitized – a gap estimated to be worth close to three trillion dollars (Brighteye Ventures, 2021b). This growth is being driven by numerous factors, including the proliferation of mobile devices and the increasing availability of high-speed internet access, which have made it easier for students and educators to access educational technology. In addition, governments around the world are investing in EdTech initiatives, with the aim of improving the quality of education and increasing access to educational opportunities (Weller, 2018; Williamson, 2021).
The EdTech market in Europe is a rapidly growing industry as more and more educational institutions and organizations adopt technology-based solutions to support teaching and learning, governments’ support for education technology initiatives, and the growing demand for flexible and personalized learning options (Jeppesen and Havinga, 2021; Brighteye Ventures, 2022). The European Union has also played a role in the development of the EdTech market through initiatives such as the Digital Education Action Plan, which aims to support the use of technology in education across the region (European Commission, 2021b).
3.1.1	The European EdTech Alliance
The functional IS delineation utilized in this study is derived from the interactions and goals of members of the European EdTech Alliance (EEA). EEA is a consortium founded in 2019, representing national trade associations, interest organizations, governmental institutions, accelerators, and clusters working with founders and providers of EdTech solutions to support the domestic and international growth of EdTech and innovation in education (EEA, 2019). From the EEA perspective, it is generally recognized that most providers of EdTech are novel ventures, with limited funds and a need for collaboration and support with research and development endeavors. The goal of the EEA is to develop a support structure that can aid these ventures with optimal opportunities for success in the educational market. Further, the EEA states a mission as a not-for-profit organization engaged in developing opportunities for digitalized learning, and for the innovation of educational practices (EEA, 2019, 2021; Jeppesen and Havinga, 2021). The consortium is further founded on the assumption that collaboration between European countries and EdTech startups are necessary for the beneficial development of a European EdTech market. The consortium boasts of connecting more than 1200 EdTech companies across the European landscape through a network of national and local actors that support EdTech startups in their early formation. The primary members of the EEA are national industry associations. Each of the industry associations in the EEA, represent a community of EdTech startups within a country or region, provide an overview of member startups, and a network of collaborators and vested partners in the development of a local EdTech system.
3.1.2	EU EdTech market TIS delineation
Thus, the members and associates involved with the EEA create the empirical foundation for functional IS analysis applied in this paper. In the case of EdTech in Europe, these intermediaries include government agencies, research institutions, industry associations, incubators, accelerators, venture capital, and incumbent firms.
Government agencies, such as the European Commission and national education departments, have played a significant role as intermediaries in the EdTech market in Europe. These agencies have provided funding for research and development in EdTech, and have implemented policies to support the growth of the market (European Commission, 2021b). They have also facilitated interactions and collaborations between EdTech companies and schools and universities, helping to transfer knowledge and expertise from academia to the market (EETN, 2019; European Commission, 2021a; Jeppesen and Havinga, 2021).
Research institutions, such as universities and research centers, have also acted as intermediaries in the EdTech market in Europe. These institutions have conducted research on EdTech and have developed new technologies that have been adopted by EdTech companies. They have also worked closely with EdTech companies to transfer knowledge and expertise, and have provided valuable feedback on the performance and effectiveness of EdTech products (EETN, 2019).
National industry associations have also played a role as intermediaries in the EdTech market in Europe (EEA, 2019). These associations have provided a platform for EdTech companies to network and collaborate, and have supported the growth of the market by advocating for policies and funding that support EdTech innovation
(Watkins et al., 2015; Reveley and Ville, 2010) .
Incubators and accelerators are organizations that provide support, resources, and mentorship to early-stage companies, often in the form of mentorship, networking opportunities, and access to funding. In the EdTech market, incubators and accelerators play a key role in helping new companies get off the ground and grow. Incubators typically provide support to companies at the very earliest stages of their development, helping them to validate their ideas and develop a solid business plan. This support can include mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs, access to office space and other resources, and connections to potential investors (Bone et al., 2017; Madaleno et al., 2018).
Accelerators, on the other hand, typically work with companies that have already developed a product or service and are ready to begin scaling up their operations. Accelerators provide intensive support over a short period of time, often in the form of a structured program or cohort. This support can include mentorship, networking opportunities, and access to funding. In the EdTech market, incubators and accelerators can play a crucial role in helping new companies develop and grow. They can provide the resources and support that these companies need to overcome the many challenges they face, such as developing a successful product or service, attracting customers and investors, and navigating the complex and rapidly changing education landscape (Bone et al., 2017; Madaleno et al., 2018).
Venture capital provides funding for EdTech startups and companies. Venture capital firms invest in these companies in exchange for equity, helping them to grow and develop their technology and business. This funding allows EdTech companies to scale up their operations, expand into new markets, and develop new products and services. In addition to providing financial support, venture capital firms can also offer expertise and mentorship to help EdTech companies navigate the challenges of starting and growing a business in the competitive EdTech market (Zider, 1998; Brighteye Ventures,
2021a, 2019).
Incumbent firms functions as intermediaries by facilitating connections and interactions between different actors in the education technology ecosystem. As established companies with strong relationships and networks, incumbent firms can act as intermediaries by connecting new EdTech startups with potential customers, investors, and partners. This can help to accelerate the growth and success of new companies, by providing them with access to valuable resources and expertise. Incumbent firms can also play a critical role in driving innovation in the EdTech market by providing support and resources to new startups. For example, incumbent firms may provide mentorship, office space, or funding to EdTech startups, helping them to develop and commercialize their ideas. This can foster a collaborative and supportive environment for innovation in the EdTech market, enabling new companies to grow and succeed. However, incumbent firms can also pose challenges and obstacles to innovation. Incumbent firms may have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo and may resist or oppose new technologies or business models that could disrupt their existing operations. This can create barriers to innovation and limit the growth of new EdTech companies. As such, the role of incumbent firms as intermediaries in the EdTech market is complex and multi-faceted, and their impact on innovation will depend on their specific strategies and actions (Geels et al., 2008; Geels, 2014).
